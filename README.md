# Assessing the relationship between stimulus duration and Mean Opinion Score for speech synthesis evaluation

This repository serves to host files necessary for replicability of my master's thesis. The primary goal of this thesis was to measure the potential effect of speech clip duration on the MOS of synthetic voices of all qualities. This thesis was completed in June 2024 to fulfill the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Voice Technology at Rijksuniversiteit Groningen - Campus Fryslân.

# Abstract

Despite the rapid advancements in speech synthesis, the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), established
in the 1990s and relatively unchanged since, remains the standard for evaluating speech synthesis. 
Lack of reassessment of MOS over time has raised many questions about the reliabilty and
robustness of the field’s predominant evaluation metric. Therefore, this study critically assesses how
non-standardized testing variables may affect MOS, using listening tests to measure how four different 
durations of synthetic speech clips interact with the MOS ratings of three different synthetic
voices. While the results show that duration does not have a statistically significant impact on the
MOS of a synthetic voice, therefore producing inconclusive results, there is promise in continued
research as shown by the 33.9% reported effect size. This moderately strong effect size suggests the
possibility of a meaningful association between duration and MOS. Overall, this study highlights
the lack of standardization present in MOS evaluation and the questions the reliability of this 
evaluation metric. It is therefore suggested to continue MOS research on not only duration, but also other
unstandardized variables, as well as the implementation of best practices in MOS testing.
